## About Has One Relationship Laravel
A one-to-one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. For example, a User model might be associated with one Phone model. To define this relationship, we will place a phone method on the User model. The phone method should call the hasOne method and return its result. The hasOne method is available to your model via the model's Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model base class
